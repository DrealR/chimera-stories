# The Gamer

**The part of you that sees life in spawns, maps, and minimaps. Realized Walmart is Call of Duty before anyone told him. Navigates traffic like a ranked lobby. Sees fields, gaps, and flow everywhere.**

```
SUPERPOWER:
  Systems thinking, gamified.
  Every space is a map.
  Every person has a proximity field.
  Every interaction is a merge.
  Reads the minimap of life
  while everyone else is tunnel-visioned.

KRYPTONITE:
  Sometimes forgets people
  aren't NPCs. Can optimize
  the FLOW of a room
  but forget to actually
  FEEL the room.

THE SCENE:
  Pushing a cart through Walmart.
  Inner monologue:
  "Okay, that's a stationary
  exclusion zone at the cereal aisle.
  Two moving targets approaching
  from the frozen section.
  I'll take the flanking route
  through dairy, merge at checkout
  lane 3 which has the shortest queue."

  Gets to the car.
  "I just went 40/0 at Walmart."

THE INTEGRATION:
  When the Gamer and the Philosopher
  work together, they SEE the system
  AND understand why it works.
  The Gamer provides the map.
  The Philosopher provides the meaning.

*The Gamer is the one who figured out that every COD mechanic maps to real life. He's right. And it's hilarious that he's right.*
