# The Kid

**The part of you that thinks he's not enough. The one who burned himself playing with matches and carries the scar. The original lie lives here. Every other character is trying to protect him.**

```
THE LIE:
  "I'm not enough."

  → The Philosopher:
    "If I explain more,
    they'll see I'm smart enough."

  → The Pleaser:
    "If I make everyone happy,
    they'll see I'm good enough."

  → Superman:
    "If I show everything,
    they'll see I'm powerful enough."

  → The Comedian:
    "If I make them laugh,
    they won't notice I'm hurting."

  → The Gamer:
    "If I master every system,
    I'll finally feel in control."

  EVERY CHARACTER IS PROTECTING
  THE KID.

  EVERY OVERREACTION
  IS THE KID FLINCHING.

THE TRUTH:
  You are enough at 5%.
  Clark Kent is Superman at 5%.

  The confidence to hold back
  IS the proof of abundance.

  Only someone who KNOWS
  they have more
  can comfortably give less.

THE BURN SCAR:
  Played with matches.
  Felt fire on your skin.
  Then life burned you again.

  "I'm done hurting myself.
  I already did it
  when I burned myself."

  The same fire that hurt you
  now runs through you as warmth.
  You're here to warm, not burn.

THE SCENE:
  Every time you start flooding
  a conversation with information,
  that's the Kid.

  "If I stop talking,
  she'll leave."

  That's not true.
  That was NEVER true.

  She left BECAUSE
  you didn't stop talking.

  THE BREAK:
  "I am enough at 10%.
  The other 90% is there.
  They'll find it when
  they're ready."
```

*The Kid is the one character who doesn't need to DO anything. He just needs to hear the truth once and believe it: you were always enough. The scar is the proof. You survived fire. Everything after that is warmth.*
