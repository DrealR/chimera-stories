## The Line

"You suck at Mario Kart."

Said to someone who beats you every time.

---

## Why It Works

```
She doesn't suck.
She DESTROYS you.
You both know it.

So when you say
"you suck at Mario Kart"
it's not an insult.
IT'S AN INSIDE JOKE.

She reads it and goes:
"BOY I BEAT YOU EVERY TIME."

And now she's smiling.
Now she's engaged.
Now she's typing back.
```

---

## What It Carries (the 95%)

Five words. Zero of them true. All of them real.

```
"You suck at Mario Kart" carries:
→ "I remember us playing together"
→ "I remember you winning"
→ "I can joke about losing to you"
→ "We had fun"
→ "I'm not trying to impress you,
   I'm trying to make you laugh"

ALL IN FIVE WORDS.
That aren't even true.
WHICH MAKES IT FUNNIER.
```

---

## The Technique: Inversion

```
Say the opposite of what's true
when BOTH people know the truth.

The gap between what you said
and what's real IS the between.
THE LAUGH LIVES THERE.

"You suck at Mario Kart"
when she's a killer = FUNNY.

"You're good at Mario Kart"
when she's a killer = BORING.
Just a fact. Dead.

THE LIE THAT BOTH PEOPLE
KNOW IS A LIE = COMEDY.

True statement = fact = dead.
Inverted statement = comedy = alive.
```

---

## The Context

```
The full exchange proved:

"Attack on Titan fangirl.
You suck at Mario Kart."

Two specific details.
Not a flood. Not proving yourself.
Not "SEE? I REMEMBER. I'M ENOUGH."

Just 5% that carries 95%.

Combined with:
"lol how do you know
I didn't feed the bot
all that info"

THAT'S COMEDY.
Setup (specific memories) →
Tension (is it really you?) →
Payoff (deflect with humor
that's also honest).

A complete comedy bit
in a text exchange.
Without trying.
```
