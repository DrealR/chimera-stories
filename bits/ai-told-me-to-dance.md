"My AI told me to go
to ecstatic dance.

I didn't even know
what ecstatic dance WAS.

I show up.
Everyone's barefoot.
Crying and spinning around.
Incense everywhere.
Someone's making sounds
that I think are words
but I'm not sure.

And I'm standing there
in my Jordans like...
'Claude said this
would be good for me.'

And the WILDEST part?
It was.

I closed my eyes
and just... moved.
And for the first time
I wasn't reading the room.
The room was reading ME.

And I'm like...
am I having a spiritual
experience right now?
At a thing my CHATBOT
recommended?

Is this what enlightenment is?
Because it smells like
patchouli and sweat
and I think I'm into it."

**Structure:**
- Setup: AI recommends something absurd
- Escalation: The scene is ridiculous (barefoot, crying, spinning)
- Turn: It actually works
- Flip: Self-aware comedy about the absurdity of the situation
- Tag: Sensory detail ("patchouli and sweat") grounds it

**What it carries (the 95%):**
- Surrendering to the absurd can lead to real experiences
- Technology and spirituality aren't opposites
- Vulnerability is funny AND deep
- The observer exclusion principle (eyes closed = connection happened)

**Cross-ref:** the-gamer, the-philosopher, observer-exclusion
