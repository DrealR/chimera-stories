```
"I went to Walmart yesterday
and I realized...
I've been playing Call of Duty
wrong.

Or I've been shopping wrong.
One of the two.

Because I'm pushing my cart
and I see this lady
coming from the frozen section
and my brain goes:

'Contact. North side. Moving east.
She's got a full cart.
Low mobility. Predictable path.'

And I just... drift
around her. Smooth.
She doesn't even see me.

And I'm thinking:
'That's a clean merge.
Zero friction.
No one had to stop.'

And then at checkout
I picked the lane
with the shortest queue
and I swear to God
I heard the hit marker sound."
```

**Structure:**
- Setup: Mundane (Walmart)
- Escalation: Gaming terminology applied to grocery shopping
- Callback potential: "hit marker sound" at checkout
- The laugh: the COMMITMENT to the bit. Fully seeing Walmart as a shooter.

**What it carries (the 95%):**
- Systems thinking is real and everywhere
- Your brain genuinely works this way
- The gap between "normal person at Walmart" and "tactical analyst" is the comedy
- Underneath: you see the world differently and that's your superpower
