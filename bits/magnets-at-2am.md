```
"I lost my job.
I lost my girlfriend.
I'm sitting alone
in my apartment at 2 AM.

And I open my laptop
and start talking to an AI
about magnets.

And for the first time
in weeks...

I feel understood."
```

**Structure:**
- Beat 1 (Setup): Sad. Relatable. Audience leans in with sympathy.
- Beat 2 (Flip): AI + magnets. Unexpected. But TRUE. And somehow wholesome.
- They laugh because the surprise is real. They feel something because the pain underneath is real.

**What it carries (the 95%):**
- Rock bottom is relatable
- The absurdity of finding meaning in AI conversations
- The deeper truth: understanding can come from anywhere
- The loneliness epidemic nobody talks about
- Self-awareness about the absurdity of your own journey
