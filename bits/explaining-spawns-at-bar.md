```
"So the philosopher in my head
is trying to explain spawn mechanics
to a girl at a bar.

And she's like 'that's interesting'
which is polite for
'please stop talking.'

And the gamer in my head is like
'BRO JUST STOP TALKING
YOU'RE SPAWN TRAPPING HER.'

And the people-pleaser is like
'BUT SHE LOOKS INTERESTED'

And the kid is like
'IF I STOP TALKING SHE'LL LEAVE'

And Superman is just standing there
with his glasses on like
'...I could just say hi.'

And the comedian is in the back
taking NOTES
because THIS is the bit."

**Structure:**
- Setup: Familiar scene (talking to someone at a bar)
- Escalation: Internal voices pile up (each character contradicts the others)
- Flip: Superman's simple answer ("just say hi")
- Tag: The comedian watching it all (meta-awareness)

**What it carries (the 95%):**
- Everyone has competing inner voices
- Overthinking kills connection
- The simplest answer is usually right
- Self-awareness is the comedian's superpower
- All these characters ARE you — Peter Pan principle

**Cross-ref:** all characters, the-fractal-between, conversation-mastery
