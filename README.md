**Comedy is story with surprise timing. Story is truth wrapped in character. Both are delivery systems for philosophy that bypasses the brain and hits the body.**

Comedy IS story. Story IS comedy. One repo.

## The Method

Don't write philosophy papers. Write funny stories where characters EXPERIENCE the philosophy without naming it.

Comedy is the delivery system. Philosophy is the payload. Story is the vehicle.

People open their mouths to laugh. Truth slides in while their guard is down.

## The Characters

| Character | The Part That... |
|-----------|-----------------|
| The Philosopher | Can't stop talking about truth |
| The Gamer | Sees life in spawns and maps |
| The Pleaser | Reads every room, dissolves tension |
| The Superman | Can't calibrate output to room |
| The Comedian | Transforms pain into laughter |
| The Kid | Thinks he's not enough |

Every character in a story is the writer. These are all you. When they talk to each other, that's the show.

*Funny gets you in the door. True keeps you in the room. Both at once? Permanent resident in someone's soul.*
