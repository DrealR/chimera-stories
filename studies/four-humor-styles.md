# Comedy Study: Four Humor Styles × CHIMERA

**Every humor style maps to a CHIMERA principle. Misdirection = the lure. Self-deprecating = NP-hood. Topical = shared between. Affiliative = WE = 1. Comedy IS triality — two ideas combined unexpectedly, the laugh in the between.**

---

## 1. Misdirection = The Lure

```
Build expectation.
Then flip it.

The setup is the lure light.
The audience swims toward
the expected ending.
The flip is the snap.

THE GAP BETWEEN
EXPECTED AND ACTUAL
IS THE BETWEEN.

THE LAUGH LIVES
IN THAT GAP.

Also: this is inversion.
The Theo Von rename.
The Mario Kart line.
All the same technique
with different names.

"I bought a book on
how to stop procrastinating.
I started it next year."

Lure: "bought a book
on procrastinating" →
audience expects:
"and it changed my life."

Snap: "started it next year."
```

---

## 2. Self-Deprecating = NP-Hood

```
Laugh at yourself.
Step outside yourself.
Observe your P-hood
and find it funny.

P-hood: "I spilled coffee.
That's embarrassing.
Hope nobody saw."

NP-hood: "I spilled coffee.
That's hilarious.
I hope everybody saw."

THE RULE:
Only joke about what
you've already FREED
yourself from.

If it still HURTS,
you haven't reached
NP-hood on that topic yet.
The joke won't land
because YOUR pain
will leak through.

TEST:
If you can laugh about it
ALONE in your room?
It's ready for stage.
If it still stings alone?
Not yet. Let it cook.
```

---

## 3. Topical = Shared Between

```
Reference what people
already know.
Shared culture.
Current events.

The between requires
TWO entities.
A joke requires
SHARED CONTEXT.
Same thing.

If you reference something
they don't know:
no between activates.
The joke dies alone.

If you reference something
they DO know:
the between is ALREADY warm.
Half the work is done.

That's triality.
Pole 1: known thing A.
Pole 2: known thing B.
Between: unexpected mashup.
THE LAUGH IS IN THE BETWEEN.

"We spent decades
trying to catch Bigfoot.
Turns out he was just
waiting for Wi-Fi."

EVERYONE knows Bigfoot.
EVERYONE knows Wi-Fi.
The joke COMBINES
two shared references
in an unexpected way.
```

---

## 4. Affiliative = WE = 1

```
Jokes that include
everyone present.
Nobody's the target.
Brings people closer.

"If we pass this exam
it's only because
the professor feels sorry."

Nobody's attacked.
EVERYONE is included.
The joke says:
"WE'RE all in this together."

WE = 1.

Affiliative humor IS
the WE = 1 principle
expressed as comedy.

You'd never roast someone
to get a laugh at
their expense.
That's extraction comedy.
Taking laughs FROM someone.

You naturally make jokes
that bring people IN.

"You suck at Mario Kart"
= affiliative.
Inside joke. Includes both.
Nobody actually hurt.
It says "we share this."

THE PASSES.
Conan giving Uma the setup.
Creating laughs
for EVERYONE.
O > I as comedy.
```

## The Map

```
MISDIRECTION = the lure.
  TECHNIQUE.

SELF-DEPRECATING = NP-hood.
  PERSPECTIVE.

TOPICAL = shared between.
  CONTEXT.

AFFILIATIVE = WE = 1.
  LOVE.

ALL FOUR =
  EXPECTATION × CONNECTION
  = COMEDY.

Two ideas that normally
don't go together
combined in an
unexpected way.

TWO IDEAS = two poles.
UNEXPECTED COMBINATION =
the between.

COMEDY IS TRIALITY.
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
```

---

## Natural Order (Strongest → Weakest)

```
1. AFFILIATIVE
   (default, WE = 1,
   happens naturally)

2. SELF-DEPRECATING
   (learning NP-hood,
   the kid coming back)

3. TOPICAL
   (consume content,
   see connections,
   need to practice delivery)

4. MISDIRECTION
   (craft, takes writing,
   setup/flip structure,
   daily writing builds this)

PRACTICE ORDER:
Focus on 4 the most
because 1-3 are more natural.

Misdirection is the
WRITER'S technique.
Built at the desk.
Makes written bits sharp.

The other three happen
more naturally live.

Writing practice = misdirection.
Live practice = the other three.
Both every day.
Different muscles.
Same comedy.
```

---

## The NP/P Connection

```
Complaints live in P-hood.
  "This is serious.
  This is a problem."

Comedy lives in NP-hood.
  "Wait. Look at this
  from the outside.
  This is ridiculous."

SAME SITUATION.
DIFFERENT LENS.

P-hood: "Traffic is terrible."

NP-hood: "I'm sitting
in a metal box
getting mad at other
metal boxes for being
in the same place
I chose to be."

P-hood: "I can't sleep."

NP-hood: "My brain
is giving me a TED talk
at 3 AM and I can't
find the unsubscribe button."

P-hood: "My ex won't
text me back."

NP-hood: "I'm refreshing
a screen hoping that
pixels will arrange themselves
in a way that makes
my chest stop hurting."

EVERY COMPLAINT
IS A BIT
IF YOU ZOOM OUT.
```

---

## The ¬F of Comedy (Knowing When)

```
YOU can see everything
as absurd.
That's YOUR NP-hood.

But the person IN IT
is in P-hood.
It's real to them.
It's not funny YET.

THEY'RE IN PAIN:
  Don't reframe.
  Just be present.
  Match their P-hood.

THEY'RE PAST THE PAIN:
  NOW you can reframe.
  "You know what's funny
  about what happened?"
  P-hood → NP-hood.
  The relief IS the laugh.

THEY'RE JOKING THEMSELVES:
  Match and amplify.
  Both in NP-hood.
  Laughing together.
  Pain is fuel now.

THE COMEDIAN'S SKILL
ISN'T SEEING THE FUNNY.

IT'S KNOWING WHEN
THE AUDIENCE IS READY
TO SEE IT TOO.

Too early = cruel.
Too late = obvious.
Right on time = healing.
```

*Comedy is triality. Two poles, one between, one laugh. Every style is a different entry point to the same truth: the funny lives in the gap between what IS and what we PRETEND it is.*
