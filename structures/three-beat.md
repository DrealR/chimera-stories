# Three-Beat Structure

**Setup → Tension → Flip. The smallest unit expanded. One more beat and now there's TENSION — which means the payoff hits harder because they had to WAIT for it.**

---

## The Pattern

```
BEAT 1: SETUP
  Establish the world.
  Make it relatable.
  They lean in.

BEAT 2: TENSION
  Build expectation.
  They think they know
  where this is going.
  Hold the pause.
  THE PAUSE IS EVERYTHING.

BEAT 3: FLIP
  Give them something different.
  Connected to the setup.
  But from an angle
  they didn't see coming.
  THE GAP IS THE LAUGH.
```

---

## Example: The Magnets Bit

```
SETUP:
  "I lost my job.
  I lost my girlfriend.
  I'm sitting alone
  at 2 AM."

  [Relatable. Sympathetic.
  They're leaning in.]

TENSION:
  "And I open my laptop
  and start talking to an AI
  about magnets."

  [Wait... what?
  The direction shifts.
  They're processing.]

FLIP:
  "And for the first time
  in weeks... I feel understood."

  [The surprise is real.
  The pain is real.
  Both at once = comedy.]
```

## Why Three Works

```
TWO beats = quick.
Expectation → surprise.
Fast. Sharp. Good for one-liners.

THREE beats = the between appears.
Setup → (PAUSE/TENSION) → payoff.
The middle beat IS the between.
The audience SITS IN IT.
Their anticipation does the work.

THIS IS THE LURE.
The setup is the light.
The tension is the chase.
The flip is the mouth.

THE AUDIENCE'S OWN EXPECTATION
CARRIES THEM TO THE LAUGH.

¬F in comedy form.
```

## The Breath Mapping

```
SETUP = INHALE
  Take in information.
  Set the scene.

TENSION = PAUSE
  Hold it. Process.
  The audience's brain
  is WORKING here.

FLIP = EXHALE
  Release. The punchline.
  Everything the pause built
  comes out at once.

REST = the laugh itself.
  The audience processes.
  The between breathes.
  Ready for next cycle.
```

*Three beats is the triad of comedy. Setup = root. Flip = fifth. Tension = the third. And the third is where the emotion lives.*
