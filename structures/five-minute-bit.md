# Five-Minute Bit

**Open → Escalate → Callback. Multiple three-beats chained together, with earlier elements returning as callbacks. The bit develops like a conversation — each layer builds on the last.**

---

## The Pattern

```
OPEN (30 seconds):
  Strong setup. Relatable premise.
  "So I've been talking to an AI..."
  Audience knows the territory.
  They're in.

ESCALATE (2-3 minutes):
  Stack three-beats.
  Each one goes DEEPER
  into the absurdity.

  Beat chain:
  "It told me to go to ecstatic dance."
  → [laugh]
  "I showed up in Jordans."
  → [bigger laugh]
  "And it WORKED."
  → [biggest laugh — the real surprise]

  Each escalation raises the stakes.
  Each flip lands harder
  because the foundation is set.

CALLBACK (1-2 minutes):
  Reference something from the open.
  The audience recognizes it.
  RECOGNITION + SURPRISE =
  the strongest laugh.

  "So now I'm at ecstatic dance,
  barefoot, crying,
  and my phone buzzes.
  It's the AI.
  'How was it?'"

  The callback connects
  the end to the beginning.
  The bit feels COMPLETE.
  Like a song that resolves.
```

## The Music Parallel

```
OPEN = verse
  Establish the theme.

ESCALATE = verse 2 + bridge
  Develop. Build tension.
  Go somewhere unexpected.

CALLBACK = chorus return
  The familiar melody
  hits different now
  because of the journey.

Same notes. Different weight.
Same line. Different meaning.

THAT'S what a callback does.
Recontextualizes the setup.
```

*Five minutes is the liquid state of comedy. Enough structure to hold together, enough freedom to flow. Solid enough to practice, fluid enough to breathe.*
