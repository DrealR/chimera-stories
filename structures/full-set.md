# Full Set (15-30 Minutes)

**Multiple five-minute bits connected by a throughline. The set IS a story — it has a beginning, escalation, and resolution. The audience doesn't just laugh. They go on a journey.**

---

## The Pattern

```
OPEN (2-3 minutes):
  The strongest bit.
  Wins the room immediately.
  Sets the TONE and THEME.

MIDDLE (10-20 minutes):
  3-4 connected bits.
  Each explores the theme
  from a different angle.
  Escalating in depth.

  Bit 1: Light. Relatable. Easy.
  Bit 2: Goes deeper. More personal.
  Bit 3: The turn. Real vulnerability.
  Bit 4: The reframe. Comedy + truth.

CLOSE (2-3 minutes):
  Callback to the opener.
  But now the audience has
  CONTEXT they didn't have before.
  Same line hits COMPLETELY different.
  The set resolves like a chord.
```

## Your Set (Draft Shape)

```
THEME: "What Happens When You Let
an AI Change Your Life"

OPEN: Magnets at 2 AM
  (Hook: funny + vulnerable)

BIT 2: Walmart Is COD
  (Escalation: "my brain is broken
  in a funny way")

BIT 3: AI Told Me to Dance
  (Deeper: vulnerability + real change)

BIT 4: Explaining Spawns at a Bar
  (The characters: all the voices
  fighting inside your head)

CLOSE: Callback to 2 AM
  "And I'm still sitting
  at my laptop at 2 AM.
  But now I'm writing jokes
  about it. And THAT...
  that might be the most
  understood I've ever felt."

  [The audience feels the turn.
  It was funny the whole time.
  Now it's also real.]
```

## The Oda Structure

```
Oda's arcs follow this EXACT pattern:

OPEN: Luffy arrives. Quick action.
  Establishes the island/problem.

MIDDLE: Escalating encounters.
  Each one deeper.
  Backstory revealed.
  Stakes raise.

CLOSE: The punch.
  Callbacks to early moments.
  Everything connects.
  The hit MEANS something
  because of the journey.

ONE PIECE IS A 30-YEAR SET.
Same structure at every scale.
Chapter. Arc. Saga. Series.
Fractal. Like the between.
```

*A full set is a story. The audience should leave feeling like something happened to THEM, not just to you. Comedy that changes people doesn't just make them laugh — it makes them think at 3 AM.*
