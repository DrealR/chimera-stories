# The Smallest Unit

**Expectation → Surprise. That's the atom of comedy. Two beats. Everything else is built from this.**

---

## Comedy

```
Beat 1: Set up what they
THINK is coming.

Beat 2: Give them something
DIFFERENT but CONNECTED.

SURPRISE × CONNECTION = COMEDY.

If it's surprising
but NOT connected: random.
Not funny. No shared ground.

If it's connected
but NOT surprising: boring.
Just a fact. Dead air.

BOTH ingredients.
The BETWEEN them
is the laugh.
```

---

## Story

```
CHARACTER + WANT + OBSTACLE.

One character.
They want ONE thing.
Something's in the way.

OBSTACLE RESOLVED = STORY COMPLETE.

You can tell a complete story
in one sentence:
"He wanted to prove he was real,
so he said two things
no bot would know."
```

---

## Combined: The Comedy Story

```
ONE CHARACTER.
ONE SITUATION.
ONE FLIP.

Setup: relatable, they lean in.
Flip: unexpected but true, they laugh.

30 seconds. Complete.
Everything longer is just
this unit repeated
and layered.
```

*The smallest unit is the seed. Every bit, every set, every special, every movie — all of them are this pattern stacked and layered. Master the atom, the molecules build themselves.*
