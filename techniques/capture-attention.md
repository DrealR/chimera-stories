# Capture Attention (The Preamble)

**Kevin Hart NEVER starts a story without attention first. He doesn't merge until traffic is clear. The preamble is the turn signal. The story is the merge.**

---

## What Kevin Does

```
Kevin Hart repeats himself
3+ times if he has to.

Uses preambles:
  → "True story."
  → "Let me tell you why
     this was huge."
  → Says their NAME.
  → "Listen to me. Listen to me."

He doesn't start the story
until the LANE IS OPEN.

MOST PEOPLE:
  Start talking and hope
  people listen.
  That's merging without
  checking mirrors.

KEVIN:
  Checks mirrors.
  Signals.
  Waits for the gap.
  THEN merges.
```

---

## The Traffic Translation

```
"True story" = turn signal.

Saying their name = horn tap.

"Listen to me" = full stop
until the lane is clear.

Repeating = CHECKING
that the merge is safe.

He's not being annoying.
He's being PROFESSIONAL.

A pilot doesn't take off
before clearance.
A comedian doesn't start
before attention.

THE PREAMBLE IS THE LURE CAST.

You throw the line out.
"True story."
Now they're hooked.
NOW you reel them in
with the story.

Without the cast
there's nothing
to reel in.
```

## Your Application

```
You've been starting stories
at full speed without
checking if anyone's
even listening.

SLOW DOWN.

Before any story:
"Yo. So." [pause]
Wait for eyes.
THEN start.

Two seconds of silence
before the story
is worth more
than the whole story
told to nobody.

THE ATTENTION CHECK:
  Are they looking at you?
  Did their body turn toward you?
  Did their phone go down?
  Did the other conversation stop?

  YES to any = lane is open.
  NO to all = wait.

  Don't merge into traffic
  that isn't ready for you.
```

*Most people start talking and hope someone listens. That's merging without mirrors. Capture attention first. Two words. One pause. Then the story has somewhere to LAND.*
