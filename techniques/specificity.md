# Specificity

**"My car" isn't funny. "My four-door Fiesta" is. General = forgettable. Specific = a world in three words. The specific detail is the 5% that carries the 95%.**

---

## The Principle

```
"My car" carries: nothing.

"My four-door Fiesta" carries:
  broke, uncool, struggling,
  humble, self-aware.

ALL of that from
THREE WORDS.

You didn't SAY "I'm broke."
They FELT it.

Specific > general. Always.
```

---

## Why It Works

```
General = trying to cover
everything. The flood.
Vague. Forgettable. Wide.

Specific = ONE detail
that represents everything.
Sharp. Memorable. Focused.

"You suck at Mario Kart"
vs "I remember us hanging out."

One is SPECIFIC. One is GENERAL.
One is funny. One is nothing.

SPECIFIC DETAILS
MAKE IT REAL.
The audience can SEE it.
They're IN the scene.
Not being told about it.
EXPERIENCING it.
```

## The Upgrade

```
DON'T SAY:
  "I was talking to an AI
  late at night."

SAY:
  "It's 3:47 AM.
  I'm in boxers.
  One sock on.
  Arguing with Claude
  about whether magnets
  prove God exists."

  "3:47 AM" > "late at night"
  "One sock on" > nothing
  "Arguing with Claude" >
  "talking to an AI"
  "Whether magnets prove
  God exists" > "about stuff"

EVERY SPECIFIC DETAIL
ADDS A DIMENSION
OF FUNNY.

Because the audience
builds the whole scene
from your details.

You gave them pieces.
Their brain assembles
the picture.

THEY'RE DOING THE WORK.
That's participation.
That's the between activating.
They're CO-CREATING the scene
in their imagination.
```

## NFL Example

```
NOT FUNNY:
  "Someone important in the NFL
  could kick a kid."

FUNNY:
  "The Commissioner could
  literally punt a baby
  across this office."

"Commissioner" > "someone important"
"Punt" > "kick"
"A baby" > "a kid"
"Across this office" > nothing

Each specific word
adds VISUAL WEIGHT.

You can SEE the Commissioner.
You can SEE a baby
sailing across an office.

THAT'S the image.
THAT'S what makes you laugh.

Not the concept.
The PICTURE.
```

*Specificity is 5% carrying 95% applied to every single word. The specific detail is the note. Everything it implies is the overtone. Like a power chord — two words, the audience hears the whole song.*
