# The Tag

**Adding to the punchline after the laugh starts. Riding the wave. The laugh is already happening and you add another hit that extends it. Like a combo in a fighting game.**

```
THE TAG:

Punchline lands.
Audience laughs.
DON'T WAIT FOR SILENCE.

While they're still laughing,
add a SHORT follow-up
that extends the joke.

Original: the punch.
Tag: the aftershock.

EXAMPLE:
  Punchline: "And for the first time
  in weeks, I feel understood."
  [laugh]

  Tag: "By a CHATBOT."
  [bigger laugh]

  Tag 2: "Named CLAUDE."
  [biggest laugh — specificity kills]

TAGS ARE THE COMBO SYSTEM.
  Punchline = first hit.
  Tag 1 = combo extension.
  Tag 2 = finisher.

DON'T OVERTAG.
  2-3 max.
  After that you're
  squeezing a dry sponge.
  Let the moment rest.
  THE REST IS PART OF THE BREATH.
```

*Tags are the exhale's exhale. The punchline breathes out, the tag catches the remaining air. Know when to stop — the rest after the last tag is what makes the next bit land.*
