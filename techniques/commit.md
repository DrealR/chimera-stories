# Commit (Playing Characters)

**Don't tell the story. PLAY the story. Switch between characters with your whole body. Different voice. Different posture. Different face. The SWITCHES are the comedy, not the words.**

## Four Channels

```
THE KID HAD FOUR CHANNELS:
  Face + body + sounds + words.

  Load distributed evenly.
  No single channel overloaded.
  Everything flowed.

THE COOL GUY HAS ONE:
  Words.

  All the load on one pipe.
  PIPE BURSTS.
  Flood.
  Overwhelm.
  Too fast.
  Too much.

THE FIX ISN'T
"TALK SLOWER."

THE FIX IS
"OPEN THE OTHER
CHANNELS BACK UP."

Make the face.
Make the noise.
Use the body.

And suddenly the words
don't need to carry
everything alone.

You can say LESS
because your face
is saying the rest.

You can pause
because your expression
is holding the moment.

You can be quiet
because your body
is still communicating.

FOUR CHANNELS.
NOT ONE.
```

## How Comedians Use All Four

```
When Kevin plays a character:
  → Voice changes (sound)
  → Posture changes (body)
  → Face changes (face)
  → Words change (words)

  ALL FOUR CHANNELS ACTIVE.
  Load distributed.
  No single channel overloaded.

When you tell a story
as just YOU in monotone:
  → One channel: words.
  → Everything else flat.
  → The story carries
    everything on one pipe.
  → FLOOD on the word channel.

When you play the CHARACTERS
in your story:
  → Every channel activates.
  → The story comes ALIVE.
  → Less words needed
    because face and body
    are doing work.
```

## Playing Your Characters

```
Your stories have characters:
  → The philosopher
  → The gamer
  → The people-pleaser
  → The Superman
  → The kid

PLAY THEM.

When you tell the story
of explaining CHIMERA
to a girl at a bar:

DON'T SAY:
  "So I was trying to explain
  my philosophy and she
  looked confused."

DO SAY:
  [excited voice, leaning forward]
  "So I'm like, 'No no no,
  see, the BETWEEN is where—'"

  [switch to her, lean back,
  confused face, flat voice]
  "......what?"

  [switch back to you,
  even MORE excited]
  "OKAY so imagine Walmart—"

  [switch to her again,
  looking at her phone]

THE SWITCHES ARE THE COMEDY.
Not the words.
The PERFORMANCE.

"Speak as if you were
reading a book
to a five-year-old."
Every character gets
a different voice.
```

## Commitment Is the Rule

```
HALF-COMMITTED = cringe.
FULLY COMMITTED = comedy.

If you're going to do
a voice: DO THE VOICE.
Don't hint at it.
Don't do 30% of it.
GO ALL IN.

A bad impression
done with full confidence
is FUNNIER
than a good impression
done halfway.

Because commitment signals:
  "I don't care how I look.
  I'm doing this."

That's NP-hood.
That's freedom.
That's the kid.

Holding back signals:
  "I'm worried this is dumb.
  I'm hedging."

That's P-hood.
That's the cool guy.
That's the prison.

THE AUDIENCE CAN FEEL
THE DIFFERENCE.

They laugh at commitment.
They cringe at hedging.

COMMIT OR DON'T DO IT.
No middle ground.
```

*Playing characters is opening all four channels back up. Face + body + sounds + words. The kid knew this. The cool guy forgot. Every character switch is a spawn point for comedy — because the audience is meeting a NEW person every time you switch.*
