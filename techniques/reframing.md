# Reframing (The Theo Von Rename)

**Look at a normal thing. See it. RENAME it. The object doesn't change. Your lens does. And the new lens reveals something TRUE that the old lens hid.**

---

## The Technique

```
Theo Von looks at a Bible.

"Jesus binder."

THAT'S NOT JUST A NAME CHANGE.
IT'S A LENS CHANGE.

"Bible" = sacred, serious,
  heavy, don't joke about it.

"Jesus binder" =
  suddenly it's office supplies.
  Suddenly God has a desk job.
  Suddenly church is
  a staff meeting.

THE OBJECT DIDN'T CHANGE.
YOUR LENS DID.

And the new lens
reveals something TRUE
that the old lens hid.

A bible IS a binder.
It's pages. Bound together.
About one guy's work.
That IS a binder.

THE FUNNY PART IS
THAT IT'S ACCURATE.

The rename isn't random.
It's a MORE HONEST name
seen from a different angle.
```

## This Is the Spoon Protocol

```
"There is no spoon."

There is no bible.
There's a Jesus binder.

There is no gym.
There's a room where people
pick up heavy things
and put them back down
in the same spot.

There is no job interview.
There's two strangers
performing confidence
at each other for an hour.

There is no first date.
There's two people
eating food nervously
while auditioning
to be in each other's life.

RENAME ANYTHING
AND IT BECOMES FUNNY.

Because the rename
strips away the STORY
we attached to it
and shows the REALITY
underneath.

And reality is usually
absurd.

We just forgot it was absurd
because we've been calling
everything by its
"serious" name so long
we stopped seeing
what it actually IS.
```

## The Triality Lens

```
You already have the tool.

Everything has two poles
and a between.

Take any "serious" thing.
Find the two poles.
THE BETWEEN IS THE JOKE.

JOB:
  Pole 1: "career, purpose,
  identity, important"
  Pole 2: "trading hours of
  your life for numbers
  on a screen"
  Between: the absurdity
  that we built our entire
  society around this.

GYM:
  Pole 1: "health, discipline,
  self improvement"
  Pole 2: "picking up a rock
  and putting it down
  so your body looks different
  to other bodies"
  Between: we PAY for this.

DATING APPS:
  Pole 1: "finding love,
  connection, your person"
  Pole 2: "judging strangers
  by their face
  while sitting on a toilet"
  Between: this is how
  modern love works.

THE SERIOUS NAME = Pole 1.
THE THEO VON NAME = Pole 2.
THE LAUGH = the between.
```

## Daily Practice: The Rename Game

```
Everything you see today.
Give it a new name.

Not out loud at first.
In your head.

Treadmill =
  "human hamster wheel"

Protein shake =
  "muscle smoothie"
  or "bicep juice"

Headphones at the gym =
  "antisocial earmuffs"

Squat rack =
  "the throne of suffering"

Uber passenger =
  "temporary car roommate"

Phone =
  "dopamine rectangle"

Just practice.
All day.
Everything gets renamed.

Some will be funny.
Most won't be.
That's fine.

You're doing REPS.
Not performing.

The gems go in raw/ folder.
The rest disappear.

Over time your hit rate
goes up.
And you start seeing
the funny version
AUTOMATICALLY.

That's when the lens
is installed.
Right now you're
installing it.
Rep by rep.

*Reframing is inversion's cousin. Inversion flips the truth. Reframing renames the thing. Both reveal what's hidden. Both live in the between — the gap between what we CALL something and what it actually IS.*
