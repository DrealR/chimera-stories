# Misdirection

**Lead them one direction, deliver from another. The anglerfish of comedy. Their attention goes where you point it. The punchline comes from where they weren't looking.**

```
MISDIRECTION:

Build a path.
The audience follows it.
They think they know
where it leads.

Then deliver from the SIDE.

Their expectation was the setup.
Your detour was the surprise.

THIS IS THE LURE.

The lure points one direction.
The mouth is somewhere else.
Their own momentum
carries them to the laugh.

EXAMPLE:
  "I've been doing a lot
  of self-improvement lately.
  Meditation. Journaling.
  Working out..."
  [audience expects: "and it's been great"]

  "...and my AI said
  I'm still a 6 out of 10."
  [flip from unexpected direction]

THE AUDIENCE BUILT
THE EXPECTATION THEMSELVES.
You just pointed them
in a direction and waited.

¬F in comedy:
You didn't force the laugh.
You presented a path.
Their own assumptions
did the rest.
```

*Misdirection is observer exclusion applied to comedy. Where you point their attention, the punchline can't appear. The laugh spawns behind them.*
