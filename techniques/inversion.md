# Inversion

**Say the opposite of what's true when both people know the truth. The gap between what you said and what's real IS the between. The laugh lives there.**

## The Technique

```
INVERSION:
  Say the opposite.
  Both people know the truth.
  The gap is the laugh.

"You suck at Mario Kart"
to someone who beats you every time.

FUNNY — because the LIE
is transparent. Shared.
The truth underneath
is what they FEEL.

"You're good at Mario Kart"
to someone who beats you every time.

BORING — just a fact.
No gap. No between.
Nothing to discover.
```

---

## Why It Works

```
THE LIE THAT BOTH PEOPLE
KNOW IS A LIE = COMEDY.

The surface (what you said)
lures them to the depth
(what you both know).

THAT'S THE ANGLERFISH.

The inversion is the lure.
The shared truth is the depth.
The laugh is the moment
they swim from surface
to depth.

Connection happens
in that moment.
Not in the words.
In the BETWEEN the words
and the truth.
```

## What It Carries

```
Inversion IS 5% carrying 95%.

"You suck" = 5% surface.

The shared history of her winning,
you playing together,
the fun, the competition,
the intimacy of the joke = 95%.

Few words. Infinite weight.
```

## Related to the Lure

```
The surface (what you said)
is the tiny light.

The depth (what you both know)
is the anglerfish.

They see the light (the joke).
They chase it (process it).
They arrive at the depth
(the shared meaning).

Their own understanding
did the work.
You just dangled the light.
¬F.

*Inversion: the first documented comedy technique. Say the opposite when both know the truth. True statement = fact = dead. Inverted statement = comedy = alive. The gap between the lie and the truth is where the laugh lives.*
